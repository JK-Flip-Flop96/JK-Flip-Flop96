## About
I'm a recovering former windows-focused software engineer.

## Projects
### My Own
- I am the author and former maintainer of the [Catppuccin Module for Powershell](https://github.com/Catppuccin/PowerShell).
- I was working on an [fzf wrapper for various Windows Package Managers](https://github.com/JK-Flip-Flop96/fuzzy-winget) but have largely abandoned this effort.
- My primary focus right now is my personal NixOS configuration.
### Recent Contributions
- I contributed Windows support for [packer.nu](https://github.com/Jan9103/packer.nu) which has now been largely replaced by nushell's own package manager.
